# What's For Dinner

**What's For Dinner** is a prototype for a hypothetical website for
collaborative meal planning. It was created by Demetri Cassidy, 
Joshua Sullivan, and Jack Schnair as part of a semester-long project
for the Software Engineering II class (COMP.4120) at UMass Lowell.
The prototype can be viewed at https://demetricassidy.github.io/WhatsForDinner/.
